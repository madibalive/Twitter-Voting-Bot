The emergence of Internet-based social media has made it possible for one person to communicate with hundreds or even thousands of other people about products and the companies that provide them. Thus, the impact of internet interaction and communications has been greatly magnified in the marketplace. This project hopes to utilize social media as a hybrid voting platform because, while in a nontraditional sense it enables customers to talk directly to one another. The content, timing, and frequency of the social media-based conversations are becoming more important and the number one choice to voice concerns and social activism.
